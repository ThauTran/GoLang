Toic	:Line_number
Basic	:13




---------------
1st line- package declaration: create an executable or library 
	$package main

2nd line- import statement: bring in and use code from other packages. Use " ". 
	$import "fmt" #importing the fmt package

* 	$go build main.go
	$./ main

* $go run main.go

*Functions:
	$func [name] (){
		fmt.Println("Hello World")}

*Importing multiple packages:
	More packages: https://pkg.go.dev/std
	$import (
		"package1"
		"package2"
	)#each package is seperated by LINE, not by any special characters.

	$import (
	p1 "package1") #p1 is an ALIAS.
	
*Comments
	$// This is a comment
	$/* This is a block comment */

*Go Resources: https://go.dev/
	$go doc [package_name]
	$go doc fmt.Println

*Values and Variables:
	1. Literals: numbers, strings, etc.
		- add (+), substract (-), multiply (*), divide (/), remainder (%)
			$fmt.Println(2*3) //6
	2. Constants: can't be UPDATED when the program is RUNNING
		- const
			$const funcFact = "1+1=2"
			$fmt.Println(funFact) 
	3. Data Type: THREE basic catagories for NUMBERS:
		- int
		- float
		- complex
	4. Basic Numeric Types in Go: 15 different numeric types
		- https://go.dev/ref/spec#Numeric_types
	
	5. Variables: Can change during the running of a program
		- var [prefered_name] [type]
		$var lengthOfSong uint16
	6. Reading Errors
		- Format: ./[package_name]:[line_number]:[column_number]
		- Example:./main.go:4:7: numberWheels declared and not used
	7. Assigning Variables:
		- Variables are placeholder names
		- updating variables is called ASSIGNING a value to variable
		- Use "=" to assign value to variable
		- Example: 
			$var kilometersToMars int32 //declaring to variable
			$kilometerToMars = 62100000 // assigning value to that variable
		- OR: $var kilometersToMars int32= = 61200000
*String: 
	-
